# Final project Purwadhika Data Science Jakarta - Indra Pratama

Welcome to my final project, **Recommendation System & NLP series use Deep Learning**

I split this project into 3 parts:

* Part 1: Movie recommendation use content-based & collaborative filtering, used [movielens dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vatsal73/movielens-1m)
* Part 2: NLP, word embeddings and category classification, used [Lazada](https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/lazada-indonesian-reviews), [Tokopedia](https://www.kaggle.com/farhan999/tokopedia-product-reviews) & [Shopee competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ndsc-beginner) dataset
* Part 3: Computer vision for recommendation system, used [Fashion Product Images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)

Bonus: Evaluation matrix use [hotel-booking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)

All datasets can be downloaded at Kaggle

-------------------------

what should I improve next:
* Lack of curiousity: more do exploration on data use EDA before dive into a model
* Not all problems must be solved by Deep Learning, in real world we must also pay attention to real-time prediction for production

Thanks a lot,

Indra Lin
